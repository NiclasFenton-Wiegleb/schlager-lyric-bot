 Destination Paradise
 Mockingbird Again
 I haven't felt myself today
 I think I've missed the bus
 Smell the difference since it's rained
 I'm not worrying so much
 If I don't work out who I am
 I'm turning to the bible
 And I'll never play the mockingbird
 Again
 Golden river from the sun
 I need your Midas touch
 Protect me from this magic spell
 That took me out to lunch
 If I don't work out who I am
 I'm turning to the bible
 And I'll never play the mockingbird
 Again
 And I looked to the past
 And I looked to the future
 Everybody wants to be
 A significant part of history
 But very few are likely to succeed
 The birds sing frantic lullabyes
 As I take the short cut home
 I stand and wave to Emillie
 She's begging me to come
 If I don't work out who I am
 I'm turning to the bible
 And I'll never play the mockingbird
 Again
