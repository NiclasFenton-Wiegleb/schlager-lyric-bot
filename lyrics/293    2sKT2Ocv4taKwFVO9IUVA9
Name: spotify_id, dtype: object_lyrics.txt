 There she was right a-walkin' down the street,
 Singin', Do wah Diddy diddy dumm Diddy do
 Snappin' her fingers and shufflin' her feet,
 Singin', Do wah Diddy diddy Dumm Diddy do
 She looked good, LOOKED GOOD
 She looked fine, LOOKED FINE
 She looked good, she looked fine
 And I nearly lost my mind
 Before I knew it she was walkin' next to me
 Singin', Do wah Diddy diddy Dumm Diddy do
 Holdin' my hand just as natural as can be,
 Singin', Do wah Diddy diddy Dumm Diddy do
 We walked on, WALKED ON
 To my door, MY DOOR
 We walked on to my door,
 Then we kissed a little more
 Woe-oeoehh, I knew we were falling in love,
 Yes I did, and so I told her all the things
 That what i've been dreaming of
 Now we're toget her nearly every single day,
 Singin', Do wah Diddy diddy dumm Diddy do
 We're so happy and that how we're gonna stay,
 Singin', Do wah Diddy diddy dumm Diddy do
 I'm hers, I'M HERS
 She's mine, SHE'S MINE
 I'm hers, she's mine,
 Wedding bells are gonna chime
 Woe-oehw, I knew we were falling in love,
 Yes I did, and so I told her all the things
 That what I'd been dreamin' of
 Now we're together nearly every single day
 Singin', Do wah Diddy diddy dumm Diddy do
 We're so happy and that how we're gonna stay
 Singin', Do wah Diddy diddy dumm Diddy do
 I'm hers, I'M HERS
 She's mine, SHE'S MINE
 I'm hers, she's mine,
 Wedding bells are gonna chime
 Singin', Do wah Diddy diddy dumm Diddy do
 Do wah Diddy diddy Dumm Diddy do
 Do wah Diddy diddy Dumm Diddy do
