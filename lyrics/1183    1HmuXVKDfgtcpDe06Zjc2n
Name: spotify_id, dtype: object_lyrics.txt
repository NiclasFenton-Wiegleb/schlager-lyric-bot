 When the day is dawnin'
 On a Texas Sunday mornin'
 How I long to be there
 With Marie who's waitin' for me there
 Every lonely city
 Where I hang my hat
 Ain't as half as pretty
 As where my baby's at
 Is this the way to Amarillo?
 Every night I've been huggin' my pillow
 Dreamin' dreams of Amarillo
 And sweet Marie who waits for me
 Show me the way to Amarillo
 I've been weepin' like a willow
 Cryin' over Amarillo
 And sweet Marie who waits for me
 And Marie who waits for me
 There's a church bell ringin'
 Hear the sound of joy that it's singin'
 For the sweet Maria
 And the guy who's comin' to see her
 Just beyond the highway
 There's an open plain
 And it keeps me goin'
 Through the wind and the rain
 Is this the way to Amarillo?
 Every night I've been huggin' my pillow
 Dreamin' dreams of Amarillo
 And sweet Marie who waits for me
 Show me the way to Amarillo
 I've been weepin' like a willow
 Cryin' over Amarillo
 And sweet Marie who waits for me
 And sweet Marie who waits for me
 And Marie who waits for me
 And Marie who waits for me
 And Marie who waits for me
