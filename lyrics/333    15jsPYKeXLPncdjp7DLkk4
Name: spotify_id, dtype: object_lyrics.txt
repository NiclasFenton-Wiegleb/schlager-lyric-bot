 Yo Jeffrey, bust it, what are ya doin' in there?
 Word 'em up, word 'em up, word 'em up
 In the place at about this time
 DJ Jazzy Jeff an' the Fresh Prince just buggin' out
 Losin' it all, no sense
 Hey Jeff, scratch it, scratch it, man, scratch it
 That was decent, now scratch it, a quick joint
 A quick one, Jeff, yeah, yeah
 We just buggin', we just havin' some fun
 Me an' Jeffrey, he's the DJ, I'm the Rapper
 Hello, can anybody hear me?
 You can? Aight, that's good, you can hear me?
 Okay, it's clear? It's good? Okay everybody's got it?
 One, two, one, two and
 My rhymes have been written, not to be bitten
 But as it seems, some suckers keep forgettin'
 The rules about rappin' but that's alright
 'Cause in the next  minutes, I'ma have them all uptight
 Stronger than a dinosaur, better known than Santa
 Man, the battles I battle, I usually win 'em
 In less than a minute, but it all depends
 On how long it takes you rappers to realize
 That tryin' to defend yourself is ridiculous
 Didn't you get my message inside of the question?
 'Cause you're toys boys, I'm the Real McCoy
 I'm really gonna enjoy seein' you destroyed
 If I was Fred Flintstone, I'd probably own all of Bedrock
 If I was a criminal, I'd probably own a cell block
 If I was in the Navy, I would own the sea
 But I'm a poet, so I own the whole rap industry
 I'm like a lion, my man an' the streets are my den
 It's either kill or be killed, so I kill
 I kill again an' again an' again
 The X amount of times, rappers, I'll slaughter them
 I tie 'em up an' throw them in the water
 Then I'll just walk away like nothin' ever happened
 Until somebody else starts rappin'
 That's when I snap an' I'll attack an' go mad like Rambo
 Or maybe like Commando or like Lando Calrissian
 'Cause you know he was down with the Force
 Fresh Prince is the source, I feel no pain or remorse
 Think that you can beat me rappin' man you must be silly
 Man, I really, really, really, really, really, really
 Hate when people doubt my ability
 An' I have to prove superiority
 If rap was basketball, I would be in luck
 'Cause every time I freestyled, it would be a slam dunk
 Man, I'm the engineer an' you're the passengers
 Takin' on a voyage, a hip hop massacre
 The Jason of rap, Freddy Kruger of rhymin'
 An' I'm sure that you'll see in due time, man
 People will run to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
 To all, join in to this Fresh Prince mania
 My face in magazines, on your radio or stereo
 Everywhere you go, audio an' video
 A hip hop terrorist, war like vocalist
 Other rappers say, "Yo Prince, why don't you show me this
 Style now?", you must be trippin'
 It ain't no way in hell I'ma let you put your lip in my rhyme
 'Cause it's a time bomb, I'm not kiddin'
 My rhyme explodes the second it gets bitten
 I'm quick an' nimble, a status symbol
 I shop at Macy's now but I used to shop at Gimble's
 I'll drop kick a hurricane, body slam a tidal wave
 Walk through a tornado or a volcano
 But I'll be okay though
 An' here's some more info that you rappers should know
 You are the bombs an' I will defuse you
 I am the lawyer an' I'm goin' to accuse you
 Of the ultimate rhyme crime an' you will be guilty
 There's no way that you'll ever, ever defeat, beat me
 Rappin' any time of day
 Pop so much trash, man, I can't wait
 To be face to face an' hear Jeff say, "Sick 'em"
 Man, you're gonna be my victim
 You better duck an' pray for good luck, Chuck 'cause you're stuck
 You're like a Thanksgiving turkey an' it's time to be plucked
 I see you're nervous, purpose, that's how I know you're soft
 You're runnin' 'round like a chicken with your head cut off
 But just relax my power to the max
 An' I'm cuttin' no slack on this rap track, Jack
 So back up, as if you got good sense
 Or feel the fury of the Prince
 An' ya don't stop
 Yo Jazzy, why don't you rock up the spots?
 Yo Jazzy, hey Jeff, I'm psyched, I'm psyched
 Give 'em a cut Jeff
 Check out my disk jockey
 Hey Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, a fast one
 Wow, hey Jeff, Jeff, give 'em one of them fresh ones
 A fresh one Jeffrey, no music, no music
 That was decent, that was decent
 That's my DJ, that's my DJ
 Jazzy Jeff, I'm the Fresh Prince
 Hi, how ya doin'?
 How's everyone doin' out there?
 I'm just here to talk about my DJ
 I was just I was just standing' in here, really
 Really? Aight, okay, well
 On behalf of DJ Jazzy Jeff an' the Fresh Prince
 Groove, then get down, thank you an' good night
