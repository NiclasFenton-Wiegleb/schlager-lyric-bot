 One morning in June, some  years ago
 I was born a rich man's son
 I had everything that money could buy
 But freedom, I had none
 I've been looking for freedom
 I've been looking so long
 I've been looking for freedom
 Still, the search goes on
 I've been looking for freedom
 Since I left my hometown
 I've been looking for freedom
 Still, it can't be found
 I headed down the track, my baggage on my back
 I left the city far behind (ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
 Walking down that road with my heavy load
 Trying to find some ease of mind (mind, mind, mind, mind)
 Father said, "You'll be sorry, son
 If you leave your home this way
 And when you realize the freedom money buys
 You'll come running home someday"
 I've been looking for freedom (where's my freedom?)
 I've been looking so long (since my twenties, yeah)
 I've been looking for freedom (tell my father)
 Still, the search goes on (goes on, on, on)
 I've been looking for freedom (can somebody help me? Help me)
 Since I left my hometown (where's my freedom?)
 I've been looking for freedom (freedom, baby, where's mine?)
 Still, it can't be found
 I paid a lot of dues, had plenty to lose
 Traveling across the land (I missed the bus)
 Worked on the farm, got some muscle in my arm
 But still, I'm not a self-made man
 I've been on the run for many years to come
 I'll be searching door-to-door
 And given some time, someday I'm gonna find
 The freedom (freedom, freedom, freedom), I've been searching for
 I've been looking for freedom (looking for freedom)
 I've been looking so long (looking so long)
 I've been looking for freedom (looking for freedom)
 Still, the search goes on (still, the search goes on)
 I've been looking for freedom (yeah, I've been looking for freedom)
 Since I left my hometown (left my hometown)
 I've been looking for freedom (been looking for freedom)
 Still, it can't be found (and still, it can't be found)
 I've been looking for freedom (looking for freedom)
 I've been looking so long (looking so long)
 I've been looking for freedom (looking for freedom)
 Still, the search goes on (and still, the search goes on)
 I've been looking for freedom (looking for freedom)
 Since I left my hometown (left my hometown)
 I've been looking for freedom (been looking for freedom)
 Still, it can't be found (can't be found)
