 I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please (hey)
 Fold 'em, let 'em hit me, raise it, baby, stay with me (I love it)
 LoveGame intuition, play the cards with spades to start
 And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart
 Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
 I'll get him hot, show him what I got
 Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
 I'll get him hot, show him what I got
 Can't read my, can't read my
 No, you can't read my poker face
 (She's got me like nobody)
 Can't read my, can't read my
 No, you can't read my poker face
 (She's got me like nobody)
 Po-po-po-poker face, po-po-poker face (mum-mum-mum-mah)
 Po-po-po-poker face, po-po-poker face (mum-mum-mum-mah)
 I wanna roll with him, a hard pair we will be (hey)
 A little gambling is fun when you're with me (I love it)
 Russian Roulette is not the same without a gun
 And, baby, when it's love, if it's not rough, it isn't fun
 Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
 I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
 Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
 I'll get him hot, show him what I've got (let's go)
 Can't read my, can't read my
 No, you can't read my poker face
 (She's got me like nobody)
 Can't read my, can't read my
 No, you can't read my poker face
 (She's got me like nobody)
 Got me like nobody, got me like nobody (ah-ah)
