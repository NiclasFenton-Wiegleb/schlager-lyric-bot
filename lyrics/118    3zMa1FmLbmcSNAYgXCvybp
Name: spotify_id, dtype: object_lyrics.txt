 I know a place
 A place where we belong
 Where we can dance
 All night long
 Come take my hand
 When the lights are gone
 We stay awake
 From dusk 'til dawn
 Yeah
 This must be the place
 To attack with the force of the bass
 Reset!
 Seven is the number, the th wonder
 We got the sound, we're raving fast
 Enjoy the night, it might be your last
 Wizards on the keys and me on the wire
 Believe what I say, we are still on fire
 From  am to the early morning
 You can be sure it's the final warning
 I'm raw hot, super shot, gonna make your body rock
 Tick-tock, got the drop, rave on, never stop
 I know a place
 A place where we belong
 Where we can dance
 All night long
 Come take my hand
 When the lights are gone
 We stay awake
 From dusk 'til dawn
 When nothing goes right
 Go left
 As we step in the door we cause panic
 Even like the last few minutes on the Titanic
 Come on
 Keep it up
 Ah
 I know a place
 A place where we belong
 Where we can dance
 All night long
 Come take my hand
 When the lights are gone
 We stay awake
 From dusk 'til dawn
 Waste your youth
 As we cause fire in the booth, yeah
