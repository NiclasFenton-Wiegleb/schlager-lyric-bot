 (Ma-hey) hey-ama-heya-mama, heya-mama
 Ya-heya-maya, homa-hey
 I've been runnin' for a while
 Beneath your sky, beneath your sun (beneath your sun)
 Found oasis in your smile
 Your firey eye, your golden tongue (ma-hey)
 My warrior, my love, my Heaven high above
 I'm callin' for you now (ma-hey)
 My hero time to fight, my second wings take flight
 I'm reaching to you now
 We are dancing through the universe
 'Cause no one can tear us down
 Time flies by, so we put it in reverse
 All the changes crashing down
 The spirit of the hawk
 Hey-ama-heya-mama, heya-mama
 Ya-heya-maya, homa-hey (homa-hey)
 (Ma-hey) hey-ama-heya-mama, heya-mama
 Ya-heya-maya, homa-hey
 The spirit of the hawk (ma-hey)
 Hey-ama-heya-mama, heya-mama
 Ya-heya-maya, homa-hey (homa-hey)
 (Ma-hey) hey-ama-heya-mama, heya-mama
 Ya-heya-maya, homa-hey
 The spirit of the hawk
 All my people hear my cry
 Hear my call before I die
 We've been searching far and wide
 The light inside us once burned so bright (ma-hey)
 My warrior my love, my Heaven high above
 I'm callin' for you now (ma-hey)
 His brother and her muse, my panic ache my fuze
 This is our last stand
 We are dancing through the universe
 'Cause no one can tear us down
 Time flies by, so we put it in reverse
 All the changes crashing down (this is our last stand)
 The spirit of the hawk
 Hey-ama-heya-mama, heya-mama
 Ya-heya-maya, homa-hey (homa-hey)
 (Ma-hey) hey-ama-heya-mama, heya-mama
 Ya-heya-maya, homa-hey
 The spirit of the hawk (ma-hey)
 Hey-ama-heya-mama, heya-mama
 Ya-heya-maya, homa-hey (homa-hey)
 (Ma-hey) hey-ama-heya-mama, heya-mama
 Ya-heya-maya, homa-hey
 The spirit of the hawk (ma-hey)
