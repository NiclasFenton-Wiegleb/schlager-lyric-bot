 (Won't you stay another night?)
 All or nothin'
 Give me all your love, I wanna feel it
 Wanna feel it
 When we're touchin'
 Pullin' you so close, I feel you breathin'
 Feel you breathin'
 And I know when I look inside your mind
 You don't want somebody for the night
 So I hope that you read between the lines
 'Cause I've been givin' all the signs
 Won't you stay another night?
 Won't you stay another night?
 Won't you stay another night?
 On to somethin'
 I know you feel every word I'm sayin'
 That I'm sayin', oh
 Feel it comin'
 Give you all of me, I hope you take it
 Can you take it? Oh-oh
 And I know when I look inside your mind
 You don't want somebody for the night
 So I hope that you read between the lines
 'Cause I've been givin' all the signs
 (Another, another, another, another, another, another)
 Wo-wo-won't you stay another night?
 Won't you stay another night?
 Oh, girl, I swear you got a hold on me
 I feel it every time your body's close to me
 I swear you got control of me
 And I don't wanna waste your time
 Won't you stay another night?
 Won't you stay another night?
 Won't you stay another night?
