 You are bright as a night full of moon
 Butterfly you have left much to soon
 You have found you have wings and now you wish to fly
 Please don't go, oh please don't say good bye
 Butterfly, my Butterfly now I know you must be free
 Butterfly, don't flutter by, stay a little while with me
 In your mind there's someone far away
 And you'll miss all the fun if you stay
 You believe that love is elsewhere to be found
 But you're wrong, it's here, just look around
 Butterfly, my Butterfly now I know you must be free
 Butterfly, don't flutter by, stay a little while with me
 Look around, look around and you'll see
 Better loved then by me you won't be
 And if you fly away you break my heart in two
 Please don't go â€“ I'm so in love with you
 Butterfly, my Butterfly now I know you must be free
 Butterfly, don't flutter by, stay a little while with me
 Butterfly, my Butterfly now I know you must be free
 Butterfly, don't flutter by, stay a little while with me
 Butterfly, my Butterfly now I know you must be free
 Butterfly, don't flutter by, stay a little while with me
