 Albany, that once stood high over Norton Green
 Albany, whose mighty walls the people sheltered under
 Albany, proud symbol set in the Highlands free
 (This is Gordon McKenzie's story)
 Just like a song, a song that lasts forever
 (And the story of Albany, his family home)
 Albany, that once stood high over Norton Green
 Albany, whose mighty walls the people shelter under
 Albany, proud symbol set in the Highlands free
 Just like a song, a song that lasts forever
 Gordon was the eldest son, a golden eagle, so the story runs
 His brother Charles, dark as the raven
 One night in jealous rage and spite, the raven struck with all his might
 The eagle turned as quick as light and slew the raven
 Albany, that once stood high over Norton Green
 Albany, whose mighty walls the people shelter under
 Albany, proud symbol set in the Highlands free
 Just like a song, a song that last forever
 See the king's men come riding through the heather
 McKenzie's life they cry and all his land
 Silent clansmen stand motionless together
 An English king won't have a Highland man
 So the king by his decree did raze and fire poor Albany
 To let the people see his power the island justice still prevails
 And according to the clansman's tales
 A golden eagle nests forever in her tower
 Albany, that once stood high over Norton Green
 Albany, whose mighty walls the people shelter under
 Albany, proud symbol set in the Highlands free
 Just like a song, a song that last forever
 Albany, that once stood high over Norton Green
 Albany, whose mighty walls the people shelter under
 Albany, proud symbol set in the Highlands free
 Just like a song, a song that last forever
 Albany, that once stood high over Norton Green
 Albany, whose mighty walls the people shelter
