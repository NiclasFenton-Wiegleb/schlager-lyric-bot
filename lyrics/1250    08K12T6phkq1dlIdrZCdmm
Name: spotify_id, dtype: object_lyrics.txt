 Live!
 Live is life!
 Live!
 Live is life!
 When we all give the power
 We all give the best
 Every minute of an hour
 Don't think about a rest
 Then you all get the power
 You all get the best
 When everyone gives everything and every song everybody sings
 Live is life!
 Live is life!
 Live!
 Live is life!
 Live is life, when we all feel the power
 Live is life, come on
 Stand up and dance!
 Live is life, when the feeling of the people
 Live is life, is the feeling of the band
 When we all give the power
 We all give the best
 Every minute of an hour
 Don't think about a rest
 Then you all get the power
 You all get the best
 And everyone gives everything and every song everybody sings
 Woh woh woh wait a minute here guys!
 Here we go!
 Here we go!
 Here we go! (Come on, sing along everybody)
 Here we go!
