 Music is what I'm living for
 Everybody loves to dance
 With another summer romance
 Ooh babe
 Everybody likes to move
 All the fellows having the groove
 Ooh babe
 Everybody move your feet
 To the rhythm of this beat
 Everybody sing this song
 All the people having fun
 Everybody move your feet
 To the rhythm of this beat
 Everybody sing this song
 All the people having fun
 Music is what I'm living for
 Hit the dancefloor like there ain't no more
 Ain't no more time for taking your chance
 Jam digin' jam to the summer romance
 Wave your hands in the air, everyone and everywhere
 Move your body jump around check it out with this sound
 Everybody, everybody get up and sing it loud
 This is the sound that makes you feel proud
 Everybody here tonight
 We will never start a fight
 Ooh babe
 Everybody is feeling proud
 If you feel it say it loud
 Ooh babe
 Everybody move your feet
 To the rhythm of this beat
 Everybody sing this song
 All the people having fun
 Everybody move your feet
 To the rhythm of this beat
 Everybody sing this song
 All the people having fun
 When the sun goes down
 And the night moves up
 The time is right to enjoy yourself
 And doin' whatever you wanna do
 I mean everybody
 Pleasure and pain sometimes the same
 I'm not the shamed there's no name for the game
 The game that makes my heart still pumping
 Boom boom, my body is jumping
 Love everyday and night
 The sigh for peace is shining bright
 Everybody everybody, get up and sing it loud
 This is the song that makes you feel proud
 Everybody move your feet
 To the rhythm of this beat
 Everybody sing this song
 All the people having fun
 Everybody move your feet
 To the rhythm of this beat
 Everybody sing this song
 All the people having fun
 Everybody move your feet
 To the rhythm of this beat
 Everybody sing this song
 All the people having fun
 Everybody move your feet
 To the rhythm of this beat
 Everybody sing this song
 All the people having fun
