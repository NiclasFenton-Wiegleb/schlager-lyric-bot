 There's a party
 Here we start it
 There's a party
 This is a party song
 A mix the party going on
 There's a party, don't you know today there is a party?
 Open up your heart, we're gonna start it
 Welcome at the beach, this is for you, just for you
 Whoa-oh-oh-oh
 Whoa-oh-oh-oh
 Whoa-oh-oh-oh
 Whoa-oh-oh-oh
 Whoa-oh-oh-oh
 The way that I live has a big, big price
 Sometimes I'm nice, sometimes I'm ice cold
 And then it's show, I started to dance, so don't you know?
 I get down with the beat like I did in the past
 Concentrate myself, and I'm doing it fast
 Here is the question, are you ready to dance?
 When you hear my rap rhymes
 You will take your chance
 There's a party, don't you know today there is a party?
 Open up your heart, we're gonna start it
 Welcome at the beach, this is for you, just for you
 There's a party, don't you know today there is a party?
 Open up your heart, we're gonna start it
 Welcome at the beach, this is for you, just for you
 There's a party
 Here we start it
 There's a party
 This is a party song
 A mix the party going on
 You think I'm a star, I tell you you're wrong
 I just made my music and that makes me strong
 For so many people, being a star is a dream
 When you see yourself acting, then it's only a dream
 You see your brother dancing, like being a clown
 Or being a king, I mean, I king without a crown
 So now let me tell you just one more thing
 You better do what you want and you start this thing
 There's a party, don't you know today there is a party?
 Open up your heart, we're gonna start it
 Welcome at the beach, this is for you, just for you
 There's a party, don't you know today there is a party?
 Open up your heart, we're gonna start it
 Welcome at the beach, this is for you, just for you
 Whoa-oh-oh-oh
 There's a party
 Whoa-oh-oh-oh
 Here we start it
 Whoa-oh-oh-oh
 There's a party
 Whoa-oh-oh-oh
 Whoa-oh-oh-oh
