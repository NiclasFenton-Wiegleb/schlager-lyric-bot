 Let's keep dirty dancing
 Right here 'til the sunrise
 Are we everlasting
 Or is it the last, is it the last time?
 We're bringing the 's to life
 I'll be your baby tonight
 Nobody else by my side
 But your hungry eyes, hungry eyes
 You got your hand on my jeans
 Spinnin' around, Billie Jean
 What are you doing to me
 With your hungry eyes, hungry eyes?
 I can feel it coming, baby, you're the one
 Old school kinda loving, that's all that I want
 I can feel it coming, baby, you're the one
 Together in five, six, seven, eight
 Let's keep dirty dancing
 Right here 'til the sunrise
 Are we everlasting
 Or is it the last, is it the last time?
 Let's keep dirty dancing (ooh)
 Ain't no good in good night (ain't no good in good night)
 I don't know a damn thing
 Say, is it the last, is it the last time?
 You lift me up in the air (the air)
 I know that nothing compares (compares)
 This kind of feeling is rare
 Can't get enough, can't get enough (oh)
 Everyone looking, so what?
 Don't even care if they judge
 I love a classic like us
 Can't get enough, can't get enough
 I can feel it coming, baby, you're the one
 Old school kinda loving, that's all that I want
 I can feel it coming, baby, you're the one
 Together in five, six, seven, eight
 Let's keep dirty dancing
 Right here 'til the sunrise
 Are we everlasting
 Or is it the last, is it the last time?
 Let's keep dirty dancing (ooh, let's keep dirty dancing, oh)
 Ain't no good in good night (ain't no good in good night)
 I don't know a damn thing
 Say, is it the last, is it the last time?
 Oh, da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da (let's keep dirty dancing)
 Oh, da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da (let's keep dirty dancing)
 Oh, da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da (let's keep dirty dancing)
 Oh, da-da-da, da-da-da (dirty dancing, oh)
