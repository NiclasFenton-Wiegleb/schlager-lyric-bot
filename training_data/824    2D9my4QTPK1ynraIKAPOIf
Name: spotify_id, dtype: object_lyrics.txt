 Where it began, I can't begin to knowing
 But then I know it's growing strong
 Wasn't the spring
 And spring became the summer
 Who'd believe you'd come along
 Hands, touching hands, reaching out
 Touching me, touching you
 Sweet Caroline
 Good times never seem so good
 I've been inclined to believe it never would
 But now I, I look at the night
 And it don't seem so lonely
 We fill it up with only two
 And when I hurt
 Hurting runs off my shoulders
 How can I hurt when holding you?
 One, touching one, reaching out
 Touching me, touching you
 Sweet Caroline
 Good times never seem so good
 I've been inclined to believe it never would, oh no no
 One, two sing!
 We'll be, sweet Caroline, good times never seem so good
 I've been inclined to believe it never would
 Sweet Caroline, good times never seem so good
 Sweet Caroline
