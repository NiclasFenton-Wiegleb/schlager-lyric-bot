 I don't want a lot for Christmas
 There is just one thing I need
 I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
 I just want you for my own
 More than you could ever know
 Make my wish come true
 All I want for Christmas is you
 I don't want a lot for Christmas
 There is just one thing I need (and I)
 I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
 I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace
 Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas Day
 I just want you for my own
 More than you could ever know
 Make my wish come true
 Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you
 You, baby
 All the lights are shining so brightly everywhere
 And the sound of children's laughter fills the air
 And everyone is singing
 I hear those sleigh bells ringing
 Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need?
 Won't you please bring my baby to me?
 I don't want a lot for Christmas
 This is all I'm asking for (and I)
 I just wanna see my baby standing right outside my door
 I just want you for my own
 More than you could ever know
 Make my wish come true
 Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you
 Is you
 Is you
