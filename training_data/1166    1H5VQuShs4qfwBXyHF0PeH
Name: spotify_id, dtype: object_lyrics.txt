 So you face it with a smile
 There is no need to cry for a trifle's more than this
 Would you still recall my name and the month it all began?
 Will you release me with a kiss?
 Have I tried to draw the veil?
 If I have, how could I fail?
 Did I fear the consequence?
 Dazed by careless words, cozy in my mind
 I don't mind, I think so
 I will let you go
 I don't mind, I think so
 I will let you go
 Now you shaped that liquid wax
 Fit it out with crater cracks, sweet devotion, my delight
 Oh, you're such a pretty one
 And the naked thrills of flesh and skin would tease me through the night
 Now I hate to leave you bare
 If you need me, I'll be there
 Don't you ever let me down
 Dazed by careless words, cozy in my mind
 I don't mind, I think so
 I will let you go
 I don't mind, I think so
 I will let you go
 And I touched your face
 Narcotic mind from lazed Mary Jane
 And I called your name like an addicted to cocaine
 Calls for the stuff he'd rather blame
 And I touched your face
 Narcotic mind from lazed Mary Jane
 And I called your name, my cocaine
 I don't mind, I think so
 I will let you go
 I don't mind, I think so
 I will let you go
 I don't mind, I think so
 I will let you go
 I don't mind, I think so
 I will let you go
 I don't mind
