 Hard To Say Im Sorry
 "Hard To Say I'm Sorry"
 Everybody needs a little time away
 I heard her say, from each other
 Even lovers need a holiday
 Far away from each other
 Hold me now
 It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
 I just want you to stay
 After all that we've been through
 I will make it up to you
 I promise to
 And after all that's been said and done
 You're just a part of me I can't let go
 Couldn't stand to be kept away
 Just for the day, from your body
 Wouldn't want to be swept away
 Far away from the one that I love
 Hold me now
 It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
 I just want you to know
 Hold me now
 I really want to tell you I'm sorry
 I could never let you go
 After all that we've been through
 I will make it up to you
 I promise to
 And after all that's been said and done
 You're just a part of me I can't let go
 And after all that we've been through
 I will make it up to you
 I promise to
 You're going to be the lucky one
