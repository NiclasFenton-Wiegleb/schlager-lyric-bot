 "Hiya, Barbie!"
 "Hi, Ken!"
 "Wanna go for a ride?"
 "Sure, Ken!"
 "Jump in!"
 I'm a Barbie girl in a Barbie world
 Life in plastic, it's fantastic
 You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
 Imagination, life is your creation
 Come on Barbie, let's go party
 I'm a Barbie girl in a Barbie world
 Life in plastic, it's fantastic
 You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
 Imagination, life is your creation
 I'm a blonde bimbo girl
 In a fantasy world
 Dress me up, make it tight
 I'm your dolly
 You're my doll, rock and roll
 Feel the glamour in pink
 Kiss me here, touch me there
 Hanky panky
 You can touch, you can play
 If you say, "I'm always yours"

 Do whatever you please
 I can act like a star
 I can beg on my knees
 Come jump in, bimbo friend
 Let us do it again
 Hit the town, fool around
 Let's go party
 You can touch, you can play
 If you say, "I'm always yours"
 You can touch, you can play
 If you say, "I'm always yours"
