 Saturday night, I feel the air is getting hot
 Like you, baby
 I'll make you mine, you know I'll take you to the top
 I'll drive you crazy
 Saturday night, dance, I like the way you move
 Pretty baby
 It's party time and not one minute we can lose
 Be my baby
 Be my baby
 Pretty baby
 Saturday night, I feel the air is getting hot
 Like you, baby
 I'll make you mine, you know I'll take you to the top
 I'll drive you crazy
 Saturday night, dance, I like the way you move
 Pretty baby
 It's party time and not one minute we can lose
 Be my baby
 Saturday night, dance, I like the way you move
 Pretty baby
 It's party time and not one minute we can lose
 Be my baby, ooh, hey
