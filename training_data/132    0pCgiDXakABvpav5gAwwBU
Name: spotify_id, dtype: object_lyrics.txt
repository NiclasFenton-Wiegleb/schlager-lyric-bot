 Dooh dooh Dooh dooh Dooh dooh Dooh
 I ran around
 Like a lonely star
 Was falling down
 In the darkest universe
 A lonely sound
 Cause i was too far
 I couldn't find
 Any button to reverse
 And then
 I met
 That someone like me
 I did
 Forget
 About all these years
 I hit
 The Ground
 And now i live my life
 With a stereo sound
 Dooh dooh Dooh dooh Dooh dooh Dooh
 Dooh dooh Dooh dooh Dooh dooh Dooh
 Gotta live our life
 With a stereo sound
 La, la, la, la, la, la, la
 Gotta live our life
 With a stereo sound
 La, la, la, la, la, la, la
 Gotta live our life
 With a stereo sound
 I was alone
 In the black blue sky
 I didn't know
 You'd become my remedy
 Flyin upon
 I was so damn high
 My only thought
 Was about my tragedy
 And then
 I met
 That someone like me
 I did
 Forget
 About all these years
 I hit
 The Ground
 And now i live my life
 With a stereo sound
 Dooh dooh Dooh dooh Dooh dooh Dooh
 Dooh dooh Dooh dooh Dooh dooh Dooh
 Gotta live our life
 With a stereo sound
 La, la, la, la, la, la, la
 Gotta live our life
 With a stereo sound
 La, la, la, la, la, la, la
 Gotta live our life
 With a stereo sound
