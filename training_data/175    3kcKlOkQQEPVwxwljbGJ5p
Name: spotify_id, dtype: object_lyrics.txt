 The hard days are nearly over
 And we've been hangin' on
 It feels like we're getting closer
 To dawn
 We took the long way up to heaven
 And got blinded by the lights
 But as long as we're together
 I know it will be alright
 I see a better day
 I see a better day for you, for you and me, a-ayy
 I see a better day
 Yeah, everything is gonna change for you and me
 (A better day)
 I knew we were gonna make it
 I never had a doubt
 Soon we'll be feeling weightless
 Like clouds
 We took the long way up to heaven
 And got blinded by the lights
 But as long as we're together
 I know it will be alright
 I see a better day
 I see a better day for you, for you and me, a-ayy
 I see a better day
 Yeah, everything is gonna change for you and me
 (A better day)
