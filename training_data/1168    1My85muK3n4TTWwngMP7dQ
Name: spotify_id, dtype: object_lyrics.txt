 When I was just a little girl
 I asked my mother, what will I be?
 Will I be pretty? Will I be rich?
 Here's what she said to me
 Que sera, sera
 Whatever will be, will be
 The future's not ours to see
 Que sera, sera
 What will be, will be
 When I grew up, and fell in love
 I asked my sweetheart, what lies ahead?
 Will we have rainbows, day after day?
 Here's what my sweetheart said (everybody! C'mon! Sing along)
 Hey! What're you gonna say?
 Hey! What're you gonna say?
 Que sera, sera
 Whatever will be, will be
 The future's not ours to see
 Que sera, sera
 Que sera, sera
 Whatever will be, will be
 The future's not ours to see
 What will be, will be
 Que sera, sera
 When I was just a little girl
 I asked my mother, what will I be?
 Will I be pretty? Will I be rich?
 Here's what she said to me
 (Que sera)
 When I grew up, and fell in love
 I asked my sweetheart, what lies ahead?
 Will we have rainbows, day after day?
 Here's what my sweetheart said
 Que sera, sera
 Whatever will be, will be
 The future's not ours to see
 Que sera, sera
 Que sera, sera
 Whatever will be, will be
 The future's not ours to see
 What will be, will be
 Que sera, sera
 Now I have children of my own
 They ask their mother, what will I be?
 Will I be pretty? Will I be rich?
 I tell them tenderly
 Que sera, sera
 Whatever will be, will be
 The future's not ours to see
 Que sera, sera
 (Que sera)
 Que sera, sera
 Whatever will be, will be
 The future's not ours to see
 Que sera, sera
 Que sera, sera
 Whatever will be, will be
 The future's not ours to see
 Que sera, sera
 Que sera, sera
 Que sera, sera
