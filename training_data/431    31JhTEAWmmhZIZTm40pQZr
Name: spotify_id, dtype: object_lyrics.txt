 The chase is better than the catch
 Transforming the tunes
 We need your support
 If you got the breath back
 It's the first page of the second chapter
 Hold your back for the rhythym attack
 Coming down on the floor like a maniac
 Hold your back for the rhythym attack
 Get down in full effect
 Hold your back for the rhythym attack
 Coming down on the floor like a maniac
 Hold your track so clean up the dish
 By the way how much is the fish?
 How much is the fish?
 Here we go
 Here we go
 Here we go again
 Yeah!
 Sunshine in the air
 We're breaking the rules
 Ignore the machine
 You wont ever stop this
 The chase is better than the catch
 Hold your back for the rhythym attack
 Coming down on the floor like a maniac
 Hold your back for the rhythym attack
 Get down in full effect
 Hold your back for the rhythym attack
 Coming down on the floor like a maniac
 Hold your track so clean up the dish
 By the way how much is the fish?
 How much is the fish?
 Yee-hah!
 Sunshine in the air
 Core!
 Na-na, na, na, na, na, na, na
 Everybody (na-na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
 Come on (na-na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
 Together (na-na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
 Yeah (na-na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
 Yeah! (Na-na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
 How much is the fish? (Na-na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
 (Na-na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
 (Na-na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
 Yeah (na-na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
 (Na-na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
 Come on, come on
 Aah!
