 Couldn't see me

 From my telephone
 Got hella dough

 Want me to love them long time
 And I tell 'em no

 Nagasaki to Seoul
 You can find me in Shanghai
 You know what those shots of Baijiu do
 Got these Asian girls dancing on the couches
 Yeah they know me
 And they singing every word like they was at the karaoke huh
