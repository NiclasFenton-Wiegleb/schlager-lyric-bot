 (God, I wish I never met you)
 (I, I keep forgetting to forget you, mm)
 I'm driving down the coast of Delaware
 I had to leave before I fall off the tightrope
 Run for my life 'cause babe, I'm well aware
 Need to get out of here right now
 Outta my head
 Yes, I'm beggin' you
 I'm beggin', I'm beggin' you
 I'm driving so fast
 But my heart won't move
 Whatever, whatever I do
 God, I wish I never met you
 I, I keep forgetting to forget you
 And from the start, I should've known you're bad news
 I, I keep forgetting to forget you
 God, I wish I never met you
 I, I keep forgetting to forget you
 And from the start, I should've known you're bad news
 I, I keep forgetting to forget you
 I'd pay a fortune for amnesia (amnesia)
 And here I'm tryin' not to jump off the deep end
 In every face, I see a piece of ya
 And yeah, I dream of my freedom
 Outta my head
 Yes, I'm beggin' you
 I'm beggin', I'm beggin' you
 I'm driving so fast
 But my heart won't move
 Whatever, whatever I do
 God, I wish I never met you
 I, I keep forgetting to forget you
 God, I wish I never met you
 I, I keep forgetting to forget you
 And from the start, I should've known you're bad news
 I, I keep forgetting to forget you
 God, I -
 I, I keep forgetting to forget you
 God, I -
 I, I keep forgetting to forget you
 (God, I wish I never met you)
 (I, I keep forgetting to forget you)
 Forget You
