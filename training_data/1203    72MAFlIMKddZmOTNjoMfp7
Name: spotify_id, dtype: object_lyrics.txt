 So many people looking for happiness
 Expecting more of a brighter day
 You'd sell your soul running from loneliness
 Instead of giving yourself away
 When you walking in the sky
 Heaven's holding hands with you
 So you better learn to fly
 Before you're falling through
 'Cause I'm walking in the sky
 Heaven's holding hands with me
 Now I think I've learned to fly
 I'm happy just to be
 I'm happy just to be
 I'm happy just to be
 You guide me here asking the question why
 I used to close every open door
 I'll find the sun even on cloudy skies
 I have my time and I don't need more
 When you're walking in the sky
 Heaven's holding hands with you
 So you better learn to fly
 Before you're falling through
 'Cause I'm walking in the sky
 Heaven's holding hands with me
 Now I think I've learnt to fly
 I'm happy just to be
 I'm happy just to be
 'Cause I'm walking in the sky
 Now I think I've learn to fly
