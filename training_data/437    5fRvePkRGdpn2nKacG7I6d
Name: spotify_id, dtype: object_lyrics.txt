 Yah-yah-yah coco jamboo, yah-yah-yeh
 Yah-yah-yah coco jamboo, yah-yah-yeh
 Put me up, put me down
 Put my feet back on the ground
 Put me up, take my heart and make me happy
 Put me up, put me down
 Put my feet back on the ground
 Put me up, fill my heart and make me happy
 Here we go, gettin' smooth to the groove
 Watching lovely ladies, is as sooth as I move
 'Cause that's what they say but I can't prove
 So turn it up again and watch me move to the groove
 As we get close, you whisper coco
 I hold you in my arms and you say, "Jamboo"
 Scream and shout, turn and say Colombo
 Now I gotta go, so coco
 Put me up, put me down
 Put my feet back on the ground
 Put me up, take my heart and make me happy
 Put me up, put me down
 Put my feet back on the ground
 Put me up, fill my heart and make me happy

 'Cause there's one man and yo', well that's me see
 So let me show you round while you sip your tee gee
 But no coco loco boom while I take a pee pee
 When I hold my baby, she says I do it nicer
 I like my chicken with rice and lemonada
 And that's what you get when she shout out, "Jamboo"
 Now I gotta go yo coco
 Put me up, put me down
 Put my feet back on the ground
 Put me up, take my heart and make me happy
 Put me up, put me down
