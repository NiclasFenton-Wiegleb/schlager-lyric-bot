 Sally called when she got the word
 And she said, "I suppose you've heard about Alice?"
 When I rushed to the window and I looked outside
 And I could hardly believe my eyes
 As a big limousine rolled up, into Alice's drive
 Oh, I don't know why she's leaving
 Or where she's gonna go
 I guess she's got her reasons
 But I just don't want to know
 'Cause for  years
 I've been living next door to Alice
  years just waiting for a chance
 To tell her how I feel, and maybe get a second glance
 Now I've got to get used to not living next door to Alice
 We grew up together, two kids in the park
 We carved our initials, deep in the bark
 Me and Alice
 Now she walks through the door, with her head held high
 Just for a moment, I caught her eye
 As a big limousine pulled slowly, out of Alice's drive
 Oh, I don't know why she's leaving
 Or where she's gonna go
 I guess she's got her reasons
 But I just don't want to know
 'Cause for  years
 I've been living next door to Alice
  years just waiting for a chance
 To tell her how I feel, and maybe get a second glance
 Now I gotta get used to not living next door to Alice
 And Sally called back and asked how I felt
 And she said, "I know how to help
 Get over Alice"
 She said, "Now Alice is gone, but I'm still here"
 You know I've been waiting for  years
 And a big limousine disappeared
 I don't know why she's leaving
 Or where she's gonna go
 I guess she's got her reasons
 But I just don't want to know
 'Cause for  years
 I've been living next door to Alice
  years just waiting for a chance
 To tell her how I feel, and maybe get a second glance
 But I'll never get used to not living next door to Alice
 No, I'll never get used to not living next door to Alice
