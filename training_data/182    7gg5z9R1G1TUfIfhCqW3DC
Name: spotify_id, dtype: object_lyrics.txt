 Night turns into day
 But I'm not going home
 After seeing you
 I don't wanna sleep alone
 Just for one more time
 Let me look into your eyes
 Darkness fades away
 I'm floating on your light
 On your light
 All I want, all I want
 Is one more night with you
 I've never felt so alive
 So tonight, I'll end the lies
 (Ready)
 All I want, all I want
 Is one more night with you
 Be there right by your side
 So tonight, I'll end the lies
 (Are you ready?)
 I could walk for countless hours
 Just to see you
 Just to see you
 Just for one more time
 Let me look into your eyes
 Darkness fades away
 I'm floating on your light
 On your light
 All I want, all I want
 Is one more night with you
 I've never felt so alive
 So tonight, I'll end the lies
 (Ready)
 All I want, all I want
 Is one more night with you
 Be there right by your side
 So tonight, I'll end the lies
 (Are you ready?)
