 Hello, party people, this is captain Kim speaking
 Welcome aboard Venga Airways
 After takeoff we'll pump up the sound system
 'Cause we're going to Ibiza
 Don't wanna be a bus driver all my life
 I'm gonna pack my bags and leave this town, grab a flight
 Fly away on Venga Airways
 Fly me high, Ibiza sky
 I look up at the sky and I see the clouds
 I look down at the ground and I see the rain go down the drain
 Fly away on Venga Airways
 Fly me high, Ibiza sky
 Whoa, we're going to Ibiza
 Whoa, back to the island
 Whoa, we're gonna have a party
 Whoa, in the Mediterranean Sea
 Ee-oh, ee-oh, oh way oh, oh way oh
 Ee-oh, ee-oh, oh way oh, oh way oh
 Ee-oh, ee-oh, oh way oh, oh way oh
 Ee-oh, ee-oh, oh way oh, oh way oh
 Far away from this big town and the rain
 It's really very nice to be home again
 Fly away on Venga Airways
 Fly me high, Ibiza sky
 Whoa, we're going to Ibiza
 Whoa, back to the island
 Whoa, we're gonna have a party
 Whoa, in the Mediterranean Sea
 Ee-oh, ee-oh, oh way oh, oh way oh
 Ee-oh, ee-oh, oh way oh, oh way oh
 Thank you for flying Venga Airways
 We are now approaching Ibiza Airport
 As you can see, the sky is blue
 And the beach is waiting for you
 Whoa, we're going to Ibiza
 Whoa, back to the island
 Whoa, we're gonna have a party
 Whoa, in the Mediterranean Sea
 Whoa, we're going to Ibiza
 Whoa, back to the island
 Whoa, we're gonna have a party
 Whoa, in the Mediterranean Sea
 Whoa, we're going to Ibiza
