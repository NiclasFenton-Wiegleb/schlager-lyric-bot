 First I was afraid
 I was petrified
 Kept thinking I could never
 Live without you by my side
 But then I spent so many nights
 Thinking how you did me wrong
 And I grew strong
 And I learned how to get along
 And so you're back from outer space
 I just walked in to find you here
 With that sad look upon your face
 I should have changed that stupid lock
 I should have made you leave your key
 If I had known for just one second
 You'd be back to bother me
 Go on now, go
 Walk out the door
 Just turn around now
 'Cause you're not welcome anymore
 Weren't you the one who tried
 To hurt me with goodbye?
 Did you think I'd crumble?
 Did you think I'd lay down and die?
 Oh, no, not I
 I will survive
 For as long as I know how to love
 I know I'm still alive
 I've got all my life to live
 I've got all my love to give
 And I'll survive
 I will survive
 It took all the strength
 I had not to fall apart
 Kept trying hard to mend the pieces
 Of my broken heart
 And I spent, oh, so many nights
 Feeling sorry for myself
 I used to cry
 But now I hold my head up high
 And you see me somebody new
 I'm not that chained-up little person
 Still in love with you
 Now you felt like dropping in
 And just expect me to be free
 And now I'm saving all my loving
 For someone who's loving me
 Go on now, go
 Walk out the door
 Just turn around now
 'Cause you're not welcome anymore
 Weren't you the one who tried to
 Hurt me with goodbye?
 Did you think I'd crumble?
 Did you think I'd lay down and die?
 Oh, no, not I
 I will survive
 For as long as I know how to love
 I know I'm still alive
 I've got all my life to live
 I've got all my love to give
 And I'll survive
 I will survive
 Yeah yeah
