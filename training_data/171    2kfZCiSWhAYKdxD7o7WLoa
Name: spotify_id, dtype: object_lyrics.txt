 Halo, halo
 We spend our life on a plane that's way low
 Climbing on top of the world, flying to never get old
 We rise, we got a halo, halo
 We spend our life on a plane that's way low
 Climbing on top of the world, flying to never get old
 We rise, we got a halo
 Along with the water, we flow through the others
 We never get bothered, we just go further, don't like your promise
 They call it a failure, we call it "See later"
 We don't see the problem, we overcome it, we know we got
 The halo, halo
 We spend our life on a plane that's way low
 Climbing on top of the world, flying to never get old
 We rise, we got a halo, halo
 We spend our life on a plane that's way low
 Climbing on top of the world, flying to never get old
 We rise, we got a halo, halo
 We spend our life on a plane that's way low
 Climbing on top of the world, flying to never get old
 We rise, we got a halo, halo
 We spend our life on a plane that's way low
 Climbing on top of the world, flying to never get old (old, old, old)
 Stand up, know you got the hands up
 Say you want it all, just run around the wall
 Higher, we're supposed to fly up
 Climbing on and on, the ground is way too low
 So now we're rising again 'cause in the end, we fire
 And we are stronger than them, better than them, we higher
 We can't contain anymore, we better flow, we fighters
 So, are you watching the glow? You see the glow we got
 We rise, we got a halo, halo
 We spend our life on a plane that's way low
 Climbing on top of the world, flying to never get old
 We rise, we got a halo, halo
 We spend our life on a plane that's way low
 Climbing on top of the world, flying to never get old
 We rise, we got a halo, halo
 We spend our life on a plane that's way low
 Climbing on top of the world, flying to never get old
 We rise, we got a halo, halo
 We spend our life on a plane that's way low
 Climbing on top of the world, flying to never get old
 We rise, we got a halo
